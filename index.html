            Reasons to love technology are numerous and for a 21st century young adult, <b>what is there not to love 
            about technology?</b> Once i was 7 years old,being brought up by strict parents and not having the opportunity to hang out
            with friends,my tablet and internet<i>[Technology]</i>were my to go places. I used to marvel at how games 
            were made and I used to adore cartoons and movies with great animations. If these are products of Technology
            then I dont know what they are.
            Technology has really made life even more comfortable with e-commerce and websites,
            where I can just sit at the comfort of my home_ <i>Not having to worry about going to a busy market 
            and being squashed by other people</i> place orders for desired items and have them delivered at my doorstep.
            Being able to communicate with you all from the Stutern family woould not have been possible had it not
            been for technology considering the fact that i live in Ghana. I could not be even more grateful for having
            the chance to this course online. Even for my fellow colleagues in Nigeria, if this course was to be held in
            be a face to face course, the current economic crisis would not permit transportation from one state to another for the next 4 months.Indeed, technology eliminates problems otherwise posed by geography and time.
            Soon I'll be 30 years old and I would not be the child who used to admire animations and how applications
            work but <b>the mastermind behind amazing softwares.</b>With a career in technology I can  
            raise a wonderful family and work can be done from home.

                In my journey to extensively master backend development, I have learnt a lot. I have learnt how the internet works_ how servers download the websites and other pages we want and send them to our devices upon request.
                I have also learnt about the various steps in software development cycle and how some steps can be merged in order to create softwares that meet the needs of our stakeholders.
                I have been taught how front end and back end developers work hand in hand to complete tasks. I have mastered the skill of using html to strusture basic cards, forms and websites.
                I have also practised using CSS to style websites, basic cards, forms and tables. In my opnion CSS helps us to "flesh" to HTML's "skeleton."
                CSS has helps to bring our codes alive by the designs it helps us create by changing text or background-colors,adjusting margins and borders amongst others.

        The CSS box model has properties like the <b>margins</b>, <b>paddings</b> and <b>borders</b> which are usually misunderstood.
        The padding is the inner space between the content and the border of the box whilst the border is the perimeter of the box while
        the margin is the outermost layer of the box</font></p>
